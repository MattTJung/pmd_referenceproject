# pmd_referenceproject

This repository contains data from a joint project between Fraunhofer IWM, Freiburg and IWT, Bremen. The provided python scripts generate a structured dataset using the [PMDco v2.0.7](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology) and [TTO v2.0.1](https://github.com/materialdigital/application-ontologies). The resulting ABox is published to [github-pages](https://matttjung.github.io/pmd_referenceproject/) as .ttl and .rdf alongside all references file resources.
